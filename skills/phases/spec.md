# Specification Phase Skill

Creates detailed technical specification documents based on research findings and requirements.

## Usage

```
/sdlc spec [title]
```

## Description

The specification phase skill creates comprehensive technical specification documents that define what will be built, how it will work, and how different components interact. Specs serve as the blueprint for implementation and should be detailed enough to guide development work.

### When to Use

- After completing research and selecting an approach
- Before starting implementation work
- When requirements need to be formally documented
- For features requiring coordination across multiple developers
- To document API contracts and data structures

## Process

1. **Review Research and Requirements**
   - Review research phase findings
   - Clarify functional and non-functional requirements
   - Identify dependencies and constraints

2. **Structure the Specification**
   - Define the feature/system scope
   - Document user stories or use cases
   - Specify APIs and data structures
   - Define component interactions
   - Include technical considerations

3. **Add Technical Details**
   - Data models and schemas
   - API endpoints and contracts
   - State management approach
   - Error handling strategy
   - Performance considerations

4. **Document Edge Cases and Considerations**
   - Error scenarios
   - Validation rules
   - Security considerations
   - Testing approach

5. **Save to Documentation**
   - Save to docs/spec/ directory
   - Use descriptive filename
   - Include date and version

```

Would specify:
- WebSocket connection management
- Notification types and formats
- Subscription mechanisms
- Delivery guarantees
- Storage and retry logic

### Example 3: API Design

```
/sdlc spec Payment Processing API
```

## Integration

This skill is the second phase in the SDLC workflow:

1. **Research Phase** (/sdlc research) - Gather information and options
2. **Spec Phase** (this skill) - Create detailed specification
3. **Coding Phase** (/sdlc coding) - Implement based on spec

The spec phase translates research findings into a concrete implementation plan, ensuring all technical details are thought through before coding begins.

## Related Skills

- **doc.md** - Used to create and save the specification document
- **pencil.md** - Used to create diagrams for the specification
- **research.md** - Previous phase: provides foundation for specification
- **coding.md** - Next phase: implements based on this specification

## Tips

- Be as detailed as possible - ambiguity leads to implementation questions
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Think about edge cases and error scenarios
- Consider how the feature will be tested
- Include performance targets if applicable
- Reference research findings for key decisions
- Keep specs updated as requirements evolve
- Use pencil.md to create diagrams for complex interactions
